To get an HP48 ploting the frequerncy response of a 
Z transform, first define Z as 'EXP(X*(0,-1)).

i.e.

> 'EXP(X*(0,-1))'
> 'Z'
> STO

Now define a function to convert a Z transform
to ABS and then to DBs (if required, ABS on its own will get non log scaled magnitude)

> << ABS LOG10 10 * >>
> '->ABS'
> STO

Now place in a test function say the 7/8ths LAG FILTER

> ' 0.125/(1-0.875*Z)'
> ->ABS

Now store in 'EQ'

Now get the plot menu.
Set yrange to -40 to + 40
Set xrange to 0 to 3.142

PLOT func

The Z transform magnitude response will now be displayed in the 
HP48 graph

Adding TAU. The above will provide a mag plot where the highest frequency resolvable, Nyquist, is
pi, 3.142 etc.
This can be normalised to the sampling frequency by adding a variable TAU (ALPHA BLUE ARROW T)
to the definition of the Z operator.

'EXP(X*2.pi*tau*(0,1))'
'Z'
STO

sanity check:
tau is the sampling rate. So if the sample rate is 100kHz say, then tau = 10e-6
X now becomes the frequency, so with X at 25kHz 25000 * 2 * pi * 10e-6 = 0.5 pi, correct, so 50k the Niquist frequency would be pi.
